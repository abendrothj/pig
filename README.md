pig is a hardware-aware inference router for your own GPU machines. It schedules
generation requests across your workers, manages model loading, tracks throughput and
latency, and exposes an OpenAI-compatible API at the coordinator.

pig does not orchestrate agents, manage prompts, decompose tasks, or proxy external
APIs. Those belong in the caller. pig's only job is: *given this request, which
`(worker, model)` pair completes it fastest?*

Think Kubernetes for your GPUs, not LangChain.

## Architecture

```
your agent / OpenAI client
         │
         ▼
Coordinator (scheduler)         ← hard constraints + scoring
         │
         ├── Worker A  [CUDA]   llama.cpp
         ├── Worker B  [Metal]  mlx_lm
         └── Worker C  [CUDA]   llama.cpp
```

The coordinator applies hard constraints (context window, tool support, reasoning
capability, accelerator type, placement policy) then scores eligible placements by
load state, queue depth, throughput, and TTFT. The winning `(worker, model)` pair
gets the request. See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for internals.
## Repository layout

- `core/`: shared model, routing, scheduling, and protocol types.
- `worker/`: the worker HTTP service, backend supervision, job queue, and
  coordinator implementation; it is the runtime behind `pig worker serve`.
- `cli/`: the `pig` command-line client that starts workers and exposes the
  coordinator, model, routing, and job commands.

The `worker/` crate is part of pig's runtime, not an abandoned LAO remnant.


## Install

The repository has no published binary release; build from source:

```bash
cargo build --release
# binary at target/release/pig
```

## Quick start

```bash
# Start a worker (supervises llama-server or mlx_lm.server)
pig worker serve --config pig.toml

# Check registered workers
pig workers list

# Route a generation request to the best available worker
pig models generate --role reasoning --prompt "Explain backpressure in one paragraph."

# Start the OpenAI-compatible coordinator
pig coordinator serve --config pig.toml
```

See [docs/cli.md](docs/cli.md) for all commands and
[docs/local-inference.md](docs/local-inference.md) for worker and model configuration.

## Configuration

Copy `pig.toml.example` to `pig.toml` and fill in your worker URLs and model paths.

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `PIG_CONFIG` | Path to config file (default: `./pig.toml`) |
| `RUST_LOG` | Logging filter (default: `warn`) |
